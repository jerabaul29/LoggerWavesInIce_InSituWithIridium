# Logger waves in ice with solar panel and Iridium communications

This is the repository for the prototype of logger.

## Content of the repository

- **PCB_electronics**: details about the electronics boards.
- **DevelopmentCode**: code for the different components of the loggers.
- **ElectronicsList**: some bookkeeping of which components I need to buy to assemble. May be outdated.
- **SeedOPL**: the Seeed studios standard library. Could be used for putting the components on PCB from factory, not used now.

Quite a lot of cleaning and more detailed readmes is needed. This will happen as time goes and new series of instruments get built. If you have any questions, open an issue.

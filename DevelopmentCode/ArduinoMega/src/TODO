TODO: much more optimal would be to use SPI between Mega and RPi:
- much faster communication
- no need of usb interface between the 2
- need a level shifter chip

TODO:
do not use USB / micro USB interface of RPi; do all with header
use RaspberryPi Zero with soldered header and plug in on a PCB doing the logging.

FIXME:
- The raspberry pi is never shut down;
call the RaspberryManager::shutdown at some place
- the I file is not close at the end; possibly, need more automatic closing
